            <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <p>1. Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.</p>
            <p>2. Players take turns marking spaces with their chosen symbol, typically "X" for one player and "O" for the other.</p>
            <p>3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.</p>
            <p>4. If all spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.</p>
            <p>5. To play, simply click on an empty space on the grid to place your symbol and try to form a winning line before your opponent.</p>
